# PrivatePay 🐙

> The first on-chain untraceable, unidentifiable, private payments on Aleo.
Powered by Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) + secp256k1 + BIP 0352 / EIP 5564 + ROFL DarkPool Mixer

Simply means “Stealth Crypto Payments using multilayer forks”

## 🏆 Aleo Privacy Buildathon

PrivatePay is submitted to the **[Aleo Privacy Buildathon](https://app.akindo.io/wave-hacks/gXdXJvJXxTJKBELvo)** — *Build a Privacy-focused Application on Aleo*. We ship **7 Leo programs** for private DeFi: ZK credit scoring, undercollateralized lending, dark pool, shielded AMM, cross-chain vault, treasury management, and compliance (KYC/jurisdiction with selective disclosure). All use Aleo’s **encrypted records** and **zero-knowledge proofs**; the React app connects via the official Aleo wallet adapter and demonstrates Credit, Lending, Dark Pool, AMM, Vaults, and Treasury flows. See **[ALEO_BUILDATHON_ALIGNMENT.md](ALEO_BUILDATHON_ALIGNMENT.md)** for judging criteria alignment and submission checklist. Team and grant wallet: **[TEAM.md](TEAM.md)**. Wave progress: **[CHANGELOG_ALEO.md](CHANGELOG_ALEO.md)**. Aleo architecture and privacy: **[docs/ALEO_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ALEO_ARCHITECTURE.md)**, **[docs/ALEO_PRIVACY_MODEL.md](docs/ALEO_PRIVACY_MODEL.md)**.

**Vision:** Private payments and DeFi on **Aleo** — payment links, treasury flows, Leo Wallet, and 7 Leo programs (credit, lending, dark pool, AMM, vaults, treasury, compliance). Zero-knowledge by default.

## 🚨 The Problem: Financial Privacy is Broken

### Real-Life Story

**Alice**, a legendary dev, won the Move AI Hack and received $13,000 prize money.

**Bob**, another participant who won another prize in the same hackathon, discovered his co-founder wasn't trustworthy about receiving prize money. Bob texted all 12 winners asking for the organizer's wallet address. Within minutes, using blockchain explorers and intelligence tools, he identified:
- Which wallet belonged to whom
- Exactly how much each person received
- Their entire transaction history

**This is a serious concern.** Nobody wants their wallet exposed — it makes them vulnerable to targeted attacks, extortion, and financial loss.

### The Core Issues

❌ **Payments on public blockchains are NOT private**
- Traceable through tools like Arkham Intelligence
- Trackable via Dune Analytics and explorers
- Identifiable by anyone with basic skills

❌ **Results:**
- Fear of transacting
- Inconvenience for legitimate users
- Financial loss from targeted attacks
- Privacy violations for everyone

---

## ✅ The Solution: PrivatePay

**Where every transaction is fully private, anonymous, unidentifiable, and untrackable.**

### Core Benefits

- ✨ **Sender privacy**: Your wallet is never linked to the transaction
- ✨ **Receiver privacy**: Recipients' identities remain hidden
- ✨ **Observer blindness**: Third parties see nothing linkable
- ✨ **Simple UX**: Like Stripe links, but every transaction is a new, invisible wallet

### Key Features

🔒 **Infinite Untraceable Stealth Accounts**
- Each payment generates a fresh stealth sub-account
- Unlimited transactions, unlimited mixers
- One single DarkPool

💼 **Static Payment Links**
- Share a single payment link (e.g., `amaan.privatepay.me`)
- Each access generates a unique stealth address
- No complex setup required

🔐 **Complete Unlinkability**
- Sender cannot identify receiver
- Receiver cannot identify sender
- Observers see nothing linkable

### Payment Link → Treasury Flow (Aleo)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Sender
  participant App as PrivatePay App
  participant Leo as Leo Wallet
  participant Aleo as Aleo Testnet
  participant Supabase
  participant Recipient

  Sender->>App: Pay via payment link (amount, recipient alias)
  App->>Leo: Sign transfer to TREASURY_ADDRESS
  Leo->>Aleo: transfer_public(treasury, amount)
  Aleo-->>Leo: tx hash
  App->>Supabase: recordPayment(sender, recipient, amount, txHash)
  Supabase->>Supabase: Credit recipient balance
  App-->>Recipient: Recipient sees credited balance in app
```

Recipients can withdraw their credited balance to their Leo wallet (see docs for setup).

### Cryptographic Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Meta["1. Meta Address"]
    A1["spendPriv spendPub"] --> A2["viewingPriv viewingPub"]
    A2 --> A3["metaAddress"]
  end
  subgraph Stealth["2. Stealth Address"]
    B1["ephemeral keys"] --> B2["ECDH shared secret"]
    B2 --> B3["tweak H shared"]
    B3 --> B4["stealthPub"]
    B4 --> B5["Aleo address"]
  end
  subgraph Detect["3. Payment Detection"]
    C1["ECDH derive"] --> C2["Derive stealth address"]
    C2 --> C3["Scan chain"]
  end
  subgraph Withdraw["4. Withdrawal"]
    D1["stealthPriv"] --> D2["Sign tx"]
    D2 --> D3["Transfer to main wallet"]
  end
  Meta --> Stealth --> Detect --> Withdraw
```

**Steps (summary):**

1. **Meta Address** — Generate spend key pair and viewing key pair; meta address = (spendPub, viewingPub).
2. **Stealth Address** — Ephemeral key → ECDH shared secret → tweak → stealth public key → Aleo address.
3. **Payment Detection** — Recipient derives same stealth address via ECDH(viewingPriv, ephemeralPub), scans chain.
4. **Fund Withdrawal** — stealthPriv = spendPriv + tweak; sign and transfer to main wallet.

## 🧠 System Architecture Overview

Below is a concise, technical view of how the PrivatePay system is wired (Aleo Testnet, Supabase).

### Component Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Client["Client"]
    UI[React / Vite App]
    Leo[Leo Wallet]
  end

  subgraph Chains["Blockchain"]
    Aleo[Aleo Testnet]
  end

  subgraph Data["Data"]
    Supabase[(Supabase)]
  end

  UI <--> Leo
  Leo --> Aleo
  UI <--> Supabase
```

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant UI as PrivatePay Web App
  participant Wallet as Wallet Adapters
  participant Chain as Aleo Testnet

  User->>UI: Open PrivatePay
  UI->>Supabase: Load user data, payment links
  Supabase-->>UI: User state, balances

  User->>UI: Connect wallet
  UI->>Wallet: Request connection
  Wallet-->>UI: Account addresses, network

  User->>UI: Initiate private payment
  UI->>Wallet: Sign transaction
  Wallet->>Chain: Broadcast transaction
  Chain-->>Wallet: Transaction hash
  Wallet-->>UI: Confirmation

  Chain-->>UI: Updated balances, state
  UI-->>User: Show transaction status
```

At the center is the **React/Vite** app, which talks to Leo Wallet, Aleo Testnet, and Supabase. Privacy is enforced through Aleo’s zero-knowledge proofs and encrypted records.

### Stealth Meta-Address Flow (Aleo)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Sender
  participant Recipient
  participant Chain

  Note over Recipient: 1) Generate meta address (spendPub, viewingPub)

  Sender->>Recipient: Ask for meta address
  Sender->>Sender: Generate ephemeral key (ephemeralPriv, ephemeralPub)
  Sender->>Sender: shared = ECDH(ephemeralPriv, viewingPub)
  Sender->>Sender: tweak = H(shared || k)
  Sender->>Sender: stealthPub = spendPub + tweak·G
  Sender->>Chain: Pay to stealthAddress(stealthPub)

  Recipient->>Recipient: shared' = ECDH(viewingPriv, ephemeralPub)
  Recipient->>Recipient: Derive same tweak & stealthPub
  Recipient->>Chain: Scan for funds at stealthAddress
  Recipient->>Recipient: stealthPriv = spendPriv + tweak
  Recipient->>Chain: Withdraw to main wallet
```
